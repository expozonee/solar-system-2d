          <p>
            Pluto was once our solar system's ninth planet, but has been
            reclassified as a dwarf planet. It's located in the Kuiper Belt.

          <h2>Jupiter Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Pluto is a dwarf planet located in a distant region of our solar
            system beyond Neptune known as the Kuiper Belt.<br />
            <br />
            Pluto was long considered our ninth planet, but the International
            Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.
            NASA's New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up
            close, flying by in 2015. Pluto was discovered in 1930 by astronomer
            Clyde Tombaugh. It was named by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of
            Oxford, England.

          <h2>Namesake</h2>
          <p style="width: 60%">
            Pluto was named by an 11-year-old girl.<br /><br />In 1930, Venetia
            Burney of Oxford, England, suggested to her grandfather that the new
            discovery be named for the Roman god of the underworld. He forwarded
            the name to the Lowell Observatory and it was selected.<br /><br />
            In an interview with NASA in January 2006, Venetia said she offered
            the name Pluto over breakfast with her mother and grandfather. It
            was March 14, 1930, and her grandfather, Falconer Madan, had
            announced that scientists discovered the ninth planet.<br /><br />
            "Venetia's interest and success in naming Pluto as a schoolgirl
            caught the attention of the world and earned her a place in the
            history of planetary astronomy that lives on," said Alan Stern, the
            principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission that flew by
            Pluto on July 14, 2015.<br /><br />
            Pluto's place in mythology can get a little muddled, so we asked Dr.
            Elizabeth Vandiver, chair of the Department of Classics in Whitman
            College in Walla Walla, Washington, to clarify the origins of the
            name.<br /><br />
            Here is her reply:<br /><br />
            "Pluto is the name of the Roman god of the underworld, equivalent to
            the Greek Hades. However, the Greek name "Plouton" (from which the
            Romans derived their name "Pluto") was also occasionally used as an
            alternative name for Hades. But Pluto is definitely the Roman
            spelling."

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it's unlikely that life
            could exist there. At such cold temperatures, water, which is vital
            for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior
            is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep
            inside.

          <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
          <p>
            Pluto has an equatorial diameter of about 1,477 miles (2,377
            kilometers). Pluto is about 1/5th the width of Earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            From an average distance of about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion
            kilometers), Pluto is about 39 times farther away than the Earth is
            from the Sun. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to
            travel from the Sun to Pluto.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the Sun would
            be 1/900 the brightness it is here on Earth, or about 300 times as
            bright as our full moon. There is a moment each day near sunset here
            on Earth when the light is the same brightness as midday on Pluto.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            Pluto's orbit around the Sun is unusual compared to the planets:
            it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's 248-year-long, oval-shaped
            orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the
            Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between
            Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million
            kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion
            kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.
            <br />
            <br />
            From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to
            the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than
            Neptune.
            <br />
            <br />
            One day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is
            tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the
            Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a
            retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and
            Uranus.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx.
            This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and
            another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.
            <br />
            <br />
            Charon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of
            Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet
            it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just
            12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our Moon is 20
            times farther away from Earth. Pluto and Charon are often referred
            to as a double planet.
            <br />
            <br />
            Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours – the same time it takes
            Pluto to complete one rotation. This means Charon neither rises nor
            sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same
            side of Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160
            kilometers) wide. They're also irregularly shaped, not spherical
            like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these
            moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep
            the same face towards Pluto.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pluto's moons are named for other mythological figures associated
            with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who
            ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the
            wife of discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small
            moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness and night, who is also
            the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent
            that guards the underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed
            dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels).
            And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the
            world of the living from the realm of the dead.
