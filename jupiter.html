          <h1>Jupiter</h1>
          <p>
            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and the largest in the
            solar system – more than twice as massive as the other planets
            combined

          <h2>Jupiter Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar
            system. If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit
            inside.<br />
            <br />
            Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases
            left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago. But it has
            the shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin
            around once on its axis.

          <h2>Namesake</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of
            the ancient Roman gods.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know
            it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize
            this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms
            to adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living
            things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.
            Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our
            solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy
            crust, where life could possibly be supported.

          <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11
            times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter
            would be about as big as a basketball.
            <br />
            <br />
            From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million
            kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun.
            One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the
            Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to
            travel from the Sun to Jupiter.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter
            takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate
            or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the
            Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth
            days).
            <br />
            <br />
            Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the
            Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and
            does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind
            of miniature solar system.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jupiter has 95 moons that are officially recognized by the
            International Astronomical Union. The four largest moons – Io,
            Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the
            astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the
            telescope. These four moons are known today as the Galilean
            satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in
            our solar system.
            <br />
            <br />
            Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
            Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than
            the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a
            small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with
            the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa,
            the target of NASA's Europa Clipper mission slated to launch in
            2024.
