            Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert
            world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons,
            polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.

          <h2>Mars Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter
            cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two
            closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the
            easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright
            red point of light. <br />
            <br />
            Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers – like
            NASA's Perseverance rover – are serving as pathfinders to eventually
            get humans to the surface of the Red Planet.

          <h2>Namesake</h2>
          <p>
            Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because
            its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also
            named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians
            called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is
            frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the
            Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on
            Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long
            ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

          <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
          <p>
            With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half
            the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be
            about as big as a raspberry.
            <br />
            <br />
            From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million
            kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One
            astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
            to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel
            from the Sun to Mars.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours,
            which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days
            are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6
            sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the
            plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with
            Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has
            distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth
            since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther
            away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over
            the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the
            seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit
            around the Sun.
            <br />
            <br />

            Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the
            longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere
            (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern
            winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern
            winter is 178 sols.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured
            asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass
            for gravity to make them spherical.
            <br />
            <br />
            The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of
            the Greek god of war, Ares.

            Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with
            deep grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars and
            will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
            <br />
            <br />
            Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half
            times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in
            loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it
            appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.
