          <h1>Uranus</h1>
          <p>
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third largest
            planet in our solar system. It appears to spin sideways.

          <h2>Uranus Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third
            largest planet in our solar system â€“ about four times wider than
            Earth.<br />
            <br />
            Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint
            rings, and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at a nearly
            90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes
            Uranus appear to spin on its side. Uranus is blue-green in color due
            to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows
            blues to be reflected back into space.

          <h2>Namesake</h2>
          <p>
            William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium
            Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for
            Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
            temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet
            are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.

          <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
          <p>
            With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers),
            Uranus is four times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a
            nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.
            <br />
            <br />
            From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion
            kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical units away from the
            Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from
            the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and
            40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time
            it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once around its axis. Uranus
            makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in
            about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).
            <br />
            <br />
            Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle
            to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees. This may be the result
            of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This unique tilt
            causes Uranus to have the most extreme seasons in the solar system.
            For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines directly
            over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a
            21-year-long, dark winter.
            <br />
            <br />
            Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite
            direction than most of the planets. Venus is the other.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            Uranus has 28 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting
            other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology,
            Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the
            works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. All of Uranus'
            inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The
            composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely
            captured asteroids.
