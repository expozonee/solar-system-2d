          <h1>Neptune</h1>
          <p>
            Neptune is the eighth, and most distant planet from the Sun. It’s
            the fourth-largest, and the first planet discovered with math.

          <h2>Neptune Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the
            eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun.<br />
            <br />
            More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not
            visible to the naked eye. The planet’s blue color comes from methane
            in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but
            allows blue ones to be reflected back into space – very much like
            its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using
            math. German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the
            planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea.

          <h2>Namesake</h2>
          <p>
            The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through
            mathematical calculations. Using predictions made by Urbain Le
            Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is
            named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier.

          <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
          <p>
            Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
            temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet
            are most likely too extreme, and volatile for organisms to adapt to.

          <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
          <p>
            With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers),
            Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size
            of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.
            <br />
            <br />
            From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion
            kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. One
            astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun
            to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel
            from the Sun to Neptune.

          <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
          <p>
            One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for
            Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes a complete orbit
            around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years
            (60,190 Earth days).
            <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet
            Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside
            Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This
            switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened
            most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune,
            though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun,
            Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of
            the two bodies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the
            plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial
            tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons
            just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each
            of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.

          <h2>Moons</h2>
          <p>
            Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was
            discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after
            Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was
            named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various
            lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its
            planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a
            retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an
            independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold,
            with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus
            235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton,
            Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5
            miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by
            Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is
            growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.
